# oligonucleotides-kinetics

IPython notebooks for the Markov state models analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of RNA di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides.

### Content ###

- dinucleotides.ipynb contains the analysis of the 8 dinucleotide systems (AC, CA, CC, AA at T=300K,277K);
- trinucleotide.ipynb contains the analysis the trinucleotide AAA (T=300K)
- tetranucleotide.ipynb contains the analysis of the tetranucleotide AAAA (T=275K)
- .py files are included, containing various scripts and functions used in the notebooks for the analysis.
